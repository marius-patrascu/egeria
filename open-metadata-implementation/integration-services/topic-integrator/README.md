# Topic Integrator Open Metadata Integration Service (OMIS)

The Topic Integrator integration service supports the exchange of topic-based assets
and the open metadata ecosystem.

The modules are as follows:

* [topic-integrator-api](topic-integrator-api) - defines the interface for an integration
connector that is supported by the Topic Manager Integrator integration service.  This includes the implementation
of the context that wraps the Data Manager OMAS's clients.

* [topic-integrator-server](topic-integrator-server) - implements the context manager for
the Topic Integrator integration service.

This integration service is paired with the [Data Manager](../../access-services/data-manager)
Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS).
